<h1>Cron Expressions</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><tt>cron</tt> is a UNIX tool that has been around for a long time, so its scheduling capabilities are powerful
and proven.</p>

<p>Cron expressions are used to define trigger times.</p>

<h2></a>Format</h2>

<p>A cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space. Fields can contain any of the
allowed values, along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are as
follows:</p>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Field Name</th>
            <th>Mandatory</th>
            <th>Allowed Values</th>
            <th>Allowed Special Characters</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Seconds</td>
            <td>YES</td>

            <td>0-59</td>
            <td>, - * /</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Minutes</td>
            <td>YES</td>
            <td>0-59</td>

            <td>, - * /</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hours</td>
            <td>YES</td>
            <td>0-23</td>
            <td>, - * /</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Day of month</td>
            <td>YES</td>
            <td>1-31</td>
            <td>, - * ? / L W<br clear="all" />
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>Month</td>
            <td>YES</td>
            <td>1-12 or JAN-DEC</td>
            <td>, - * /</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Day of week</td>

            <td>YES</td>
            <td>1-7 or SUN-SAT</td>
            <td>, - * ? / L #</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Year</td>
            <td>NO</td>

            <td>empty, 1970-2099</td>
            <td>, - * /</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>So cron expressions can be as simple as this: <tt>&#42; * * * ? *</tt><br />
or more complex, like this: <tt>0 0/5 14,18,3-39,52 ? JAN,MAR,SEP MON-FRI 2002-2010</tt></p>

<h2>Special characters</h2>

<ul>
    <li><tt><b>&#42;</b></tt> (<em>"all values"</em>) - used to select all values within a field. For example, "*"
    in the minute field means <em>"every minute"</em>.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
    <li><tt><b>?</b></tt> (<em>"no specific value"</em>) - useful when you need to specify something in one of the
    two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a
    particular day of the month (say, the 10th), but don't care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put
    "10" in the day-of-month field, and "?" in the day-of-week field. See the examples below for clarification.</li>

</ul>


<ul>
    <li><tt><b>&#45;</b></tt> &#45; used to specify ranges. For example, "10-12" in the hour field means <em>"the
    hours 10, 11 and 12"</em>.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
    <li><tt><b>,</b></tt> &#45; used to specify additional values. For example, "MON,WED,FRI" in the day-of-week
    field means <em>"the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday"</em>.</li>

</ul>


<ul>
    <li><tt><b>/</b></tt> &#45; used to specify increments. For example, "0/15" in the seconds field means <em>"the
    seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45"</em>. And "5/15" in the seconds field means <em>"the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50"</em>. You can
    also specify '/' after the '<b>' character - in this case '</b>' is equivalent to having '0' before the '/'. '1/3'
    in the day-of-month field means <em>"fire every 3 days starting on the first day of the month"</em>.</li>

</ul>


<ul>
    <li><tt><b>L</b></tt> (<em>"last"</em>) - has different meaning in each of the two fields in which it is
    allowed. For example, the value "L" in the day-of-month field means <em>"the last day of the month"</em> &#45; day
    31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means
    "7" or "SAT". But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means <em>"the last xxx day of the
    month"</em> &#45; for example "6L" means <em>"the last friday of the month"</em>. When using the 'L' option, it is
    important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you'll get confusing results.</li>

</ul>


<ul>
    <li><tt><b>W</b></tt> (<em>"weekday"</em>) - used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day.
    As an example, if you were to specify "15W" as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: <em>"the
    nearest weekday to the 15th of the month"</em>. So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th.
    If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on
    Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify "1W" as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger
    will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not 'jump' over the boundary of a month's days. The 'W' character can only
    be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.
        <div >
            The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined in the day-of-month field to yield 'LW', which
            translates to <em>"last weekday of the month"</em>.
        </div>
    </li>

    <li><tt><b>&#35;</b></tt> &#45; used to specify "the nth" XXX day of the month. For example, the value of "6#3"
    in the day-of-week field means <em>"the third Friday of the month"</em> (day 6 = Friday and "#3" = the 3rd one in
    the month). Other examples: "2#1" = the first Monday of the month and "4#5" = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note
    that if you specify "#5" and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then no firing will occur that
    month.
        <div >
            The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive. <tt>MON</tt>
            is the same as <tt>mon</tt>.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>

    <li>Support for specifying both a day-of-week and a day-of-month value is not complete (you must currently use

    <li>Be careful when setting fire times between mid-night and 1:00 AM - "daylight savings" can cause a skip or a
